----------

Up to date information about the extent and location of surface water provides all Australians with a common understanding of this valuable and increasingly scarce resource. Water detection algorithms are now being routinely applied to continental and global archives of satellite imagery. However, water resource management decisions typically take place at the waterbody rather than pixel scale. 

This repository presents a workflow for generating polygons of persistent waterbodies from Landsat observations, enabling improved monitoring and management of water assets across Australia. We use `Digital Earth Australia’s (DEA) Water Observations from Space (WOfS) water classifier <https://www.ga.gov.au/dea/products/wofs>`_, which provides a water classified output for every available Landsat scene, to determine the spatial locations and extents of waterbodies across Australia. DEA Waterbodies uses Geoscience Australia’s archive of over 30 years of Landsat satellite imagery to identify where almost 300,000 waterbodies are in the Australian landscape.

Each polygon was then used to generate a time series of WOfS, providing a history of the change in the wet surface area of each waterbody every ~16 days since 1987.

*Digital Earth Australia Waterbodies. Waterbody polygons mapped by this product are shown in blue. There are almost 300,000 across Australia.*

DEA Waterbodies supports users to understand and manage water across Australia. DEA Waterbodies provides new insights into local through to national-scale surface water spatio-temporal dynamics by enabling the monitoring of important landscape features such as lakes and dams, improving our ability to use earth observation data to make meaningful decisions. It can be used to gain insights into the severity and spatial distribution of drought, or identify potential water sources for aerial firefighting during bushfires.

Installation
------------

DEA Waterbodies has some requirements which can be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --extra-index-url="https://packages.dea.ga.gov.au" -r requirements.txt
    
Once you have installed the requirements for DEA Waterbodies, install the module locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .
    
This command installs an editable version of the module in the current location.

A command line interface is available for generating wet area time series for a given shapefile. You can call the help for this interface from the command line using:

.. code-block:: bash

    waterbodies-ts --help
